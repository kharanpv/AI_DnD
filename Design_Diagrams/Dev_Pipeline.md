# Function Description_Given

We query the LLM for details about the area

We get back a list of areas/objects of large note

We take the list and details and description, and ask the LLM to generate a color pallete

We enumerate through the list; DO FOR EACH:

We generate a description of the object

We generate a list of sub-object (ie a grove of trees has fireflies, trees, ancient carved runes, hollow tree trunks, giant canopy nests)

For each sub object, we generate a description; 

DO FOR EACH:

We generate a description of the sub object

We take the description, and pass it through a function which creates a prompt for an image prompt

We take the image prompt and generate and image with the image generator and color pallete

DONE

For each sub item, we generate a geometric relationship with every other item; 

DO FOR EACH;

We ask the LLM for where it should be in relation to another object

We create a weight (heat map, Choropleth map, isarithmetic map or otherwise, this is undecided) map using these relationships

We place the object at the highest density (with overlap taken into account)

DONE

Using the relationship map, the descriptions, and the inputed description, we ask the LLM where different areas go in the whole map

We ask the LLM what which items make sense next to each other based upon the returned stitching

We return the image, and text file generated by the LLM.

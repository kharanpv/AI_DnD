### Project Sought
My main aim is to work on a project that hasn't been implemented prior in a capstone/senior-design setting. Ideally, it would implement bleeding-edge concepts. Moreover, the project must have some practical purpose that serves to be more than a proof-of-concept (i.e., something that can at least be expanded upon to create a deliverable project in the forseeable future). For this reason, I have chosen to work on a generative AI based project that incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image models to create a Dungeons and Dragons video game; something that has not fully been realized before because of the limited abilities of previous machine learning models to create endless possibilites or scenarios to enact.

# AI-powered Dungeons and Dragons

This is a senior-design project developed by Prateek Kharangate ([@kharanpv](https://github.com/kharanpv)) and Sam Weese ([@SamuelWeese](https://github.com/SamuelWeese)). The end-goal of this project is to have functional game of Dungeons and Dragons that operates purely based on player interactions with multiple AI systems that will be completely responsible for narration, story-building, and world generation. Since this is an ambitious project, we have divided the project into milestones, and we would be satisfied with whatever milestone we end up completing the project to, though we will ideally strive for a complete product.

The milestones are

1. Developing the AI models necessary for world generation, asset generation, and story generation.
2. Creating a model Dungeons and Dragons game that can be played with a human dungeon master.
3. Creating a complete Dungeons and Dragons game that has an AI dungeon master.

### Project Sought
My main aim is to work on a project that hasn't been implemented prior in a capstone/senior-design setting. Ideally, it would implement bleeding-edge concepts. Moreover, the project must have some practical purpose that serves to be more than a proof-of-concept (i.e., something that can at least be expanded upon to create a deliverable project in the forseeable future). For this reason, I have chosen to work on a generative AI based project that incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs) with text-to-image models to create a Dungeons and Dragons video game; something that has not fully been realized before because of the limited abilities of previous machine learning models to create endless possibilites or scenarios to enact.

### Project Sought
  I am looking for a project which both is applicable and unsolved, specifically in the area of LLMs and AI. I would like to upskill in this area, and learn how to effectively use and sub divide them. I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, and I realize that the difficulty of creating Dungeons and dragons with AI is extremely extremely difficult. That is why I decided I wanted to work on the part to create a Dungeons and Dragons game with LLM support (chatgpt and alike), as the problem is both largely unexplored, largely applicable, and highly interesting to my hobbies. Prateek and I are skipping ahead a year to work on this project together, as we both are interested in using AI to tackle the problem of undefined and changing rulesets for generative content for Dungeons and Dragons. To scope the project a bit tighter, we are starting by attempting to generate dynamic buildings using stable diffusion for DnD. We intend to start here, as we can begin building tools for LLMs to use in later implementations. Eventually, assuming everything goes right, we intend to have a set of tools for dungeons and dragons, and a system to build worlds which plot linear, while still being generated instead of static.

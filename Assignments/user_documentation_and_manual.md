## What is AI DnD?

AI DnD, short for Artificial Intelligence Dungeons and Dragons, is a rendition of the classic game of Dungeons and Dragons that uses machine-learning based tools such as image models and Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate a typical game of Dungeons and Dragons. As such, this project can be considered a video game that uses AI tools.

### How to install AI DnD

In order to install AI DnD, one must first clone the repository found here on GitHub. [To learn more about how to clone repositories on GitHub here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). Next, you must download the `Models` folder [found on Onedrive here](https://mailuc-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kharanpv_mail_uc_edu/EmVYlTuEC3FAi6xZJqB-GHkB6rmDqU_5euftu4KqU--LSw?e=L2svGm).

After the necessary files and folders have been cloned and downloaded, the next step is to install the application. For this, a simple `install.bat` file can be found. Execute the `.bat` file and it will ensure that all the requirements are properly set up for the application to run. At this point, the application is ready to run.

### Running AI DnD for the first time

To run AI DnD, you must double click and execute `main.exe` found within the outermost folder of the GitHub project. This will begin the execution of the application. In order to maximize performance, please ensure that you have an active, ready to use, and configured GPU (preferably Nvidia) enabled as well.

After a while, a UI will show up with three buttons, which confirms that the application is running successfully. This is what we will refer to as the _main menu_. You will notice that there are 3 options available -- _load game_, _new game_, and _quit_. The purpose of each of these options is as follows:
1. New Game - In order to start a new game of AI DnD, click this option. Upon clicking, it will bring up a dialog box confirming that this is your choice. If you choose to continue by clicking _yes_, it will overwrite any previous game session that you had started and start a new game. If you choose _no_, it will simply take you back to the main menu.
2. Load Game - This will load the previous game session again

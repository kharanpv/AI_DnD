## 1. Project Description

AI-DnD is a prototype map-generation tool for the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons with an LLM-based Dungeon Master (DM) and a text-to-image model for asset generation. The DM, based upon Chat GPT 3.5 Turbo API, generates descriptions to user requests of map objects such as name, paragraph description, size, and location. The Stable Diffusion image model using the Pixel-art-xl LORA is used to generate assets and sprites based the DM's descriptions.

## 2. User Interface Specification

The user interface (UI) was developed using the PyQt5 Python library. The UI consists of two sections:

1. Map Canvas
2. Chat Section
   * Chat History
   * Prompt Box

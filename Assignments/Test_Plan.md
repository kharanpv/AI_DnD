# Test Plan

## Description of Overall Test Plan

For this project, we will primarily focus on black-box style testing because of our employment of multiple systems not developed by us in our project. To be specific, we are employing mainstream AI models available publically on the internet. As such, we assume their internal working has been thoroughly tested and are sufficiently functional for our purposes. We will also not focus on performance tests as our project is a proof-of-concept and experimental in nature, and so performance optimization is not a priority. We will focus on a unit-testing scaled up to integration-testing format; testing inidividual components of our system followed by testing the interaction between these components.

## Test Case Descriptions

  ### 1 - Stable Diffusion Boot-up

  **Test Indication:** Functional Test
  The purpose of this test is to ensure that Stable Diffusion, the generative AI model for creating image assets, is successfully initialized and running. The test will attempt to execute the script responsible for initializaing Stable Diffusion and then will feed an empty prompt to it. The test will then verify that its associated process is active and running on the computer.
  **Input:** Execution of the Stable Diffusion Boot Script with an empty prompt.
  **Expected Output:** Actively running process for Stable Diffusion present upon process look-up.

  ### 2 - Blip Image Captioning Model Boot-up

  **Test Indication:** Functional Test
  The purpose of this test is to ensure that the Blip Image Captioning image-to-text AI model is successfully initialized and running. The test will attempt to run the the image_to_text.py script responsible for calling the model with a simple target of a white image. The expected output is a singular text description of the image. The validity or accuracy of the text description returned will not be evaluated.
  **Input:** Execute of the image_to_text.py script with a blank-white image target.
  **Expected Output:** Any text description returned for the image.

  ### 3 - MiniLlama Boot-up

  **Test Indication:** Functional Test
  The purpose of this test is to ensure that MiniLlama, the large language model leveraged to oversee the background processes of the application, is successfully initialized and running. To achieve this, the model's initialize.py file will be executed and an example empty prompt will be fed into it. The expected output is some response generated by the LLM.
  **Input:** THe execution of the MiniLlama boot script with an empty string prompt.
  **Expected Output:** Any prompt response by the MiniLlama model.

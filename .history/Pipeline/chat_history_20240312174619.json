The building stands at a height of two stories, with large glass windows on the first floor that allows passersby to take a glance at the lively atmosphere inside. The signboard is decorated with quirky letters spelling out the name of the pizzeria, flanked by the image of a cheesy pizza slice. By the side of the main entrance is a unique feature - an old fashioned red telephone booth adorning the corner. The roof is a combination of red ceramic tiles laid out in a traditional method. Embedded into the ground around the pizzeria are some outdoor seating setups.\n}"
